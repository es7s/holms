Options:
  -b, --buffered / -u, --unbuffered
                        Explicitly set to wait for EOF before processing the
                        output (buffered), or to stream the results in
                        parallel with reading, as soon as possible
                        (unbuffered). See BUFFERING section above for the
                        details.
  -m, --merge           Replace all sequences of repeating characters with one
                        of each, together with initial length of the sequence.
  -g, --group           Group the input by code points (=count unique), sort
                        descending and display counts instead of normal
                        output. Implies '--merge' and forces buffered ('-b')
                        mode. Specifying the option twice ('-gg') results in
                        grouping by code point category instead, while doing
                        it thrice ('-ggg') makes the app group the input by
                        super categories.
  -o, --oneline         Remove all newline characters (0x0a LINE FEED) from
                        the output.
  -f, --format          Comma-separated list of columns to show (order is
                        preserved). Run 'holms format' to see the details.
  -n, --names           Display names instead of abbreviations. Affects `cat`
                        and `block` columns, but only if column in question is
                        already present on the screen. Note that these columns
                        can still display only the beginning of the attribute,
                        unless '-r' is provided.
  -a, --all             Display ALL columns.
  -r, --rigid           By default some columns can be compressed beyond the
                        nominal width, if all current values fit and there is
                        still space left. This option disables column
                        shrinking (but they still will be expanded when
                        needed).
  --decimal             Use decimal byte offsets instead of hexadecimal.
  -?, --help            Show this message and exit.
